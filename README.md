## Self-Reflection:
This was a pretty straightforward and easy assignment. I had a few issues installing npm,
but I think that was due to my computer having pending system updates. That's the only reason
why it took so long. I probably could have finished it faster, but I wanted to make sure I 
followed all the directions. I think I completed everything as asked. The only thing I didn't 
understand is the Assignment Checks link, but I think that was done automatically.

### How long it took me to finish this?
A couple hours
